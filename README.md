Dog Breed Classifier using python


The focus of this project is to write an algorithm for a dog classification application.
The algorithm will be deployed within the application to solve the problem of dog
identification i.e. given a user-supplied image, if a dog is detected in the image, it
provides an estimate of the dogâ€™s breed or if a human is detected, it provides an
estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. This algorithm will potentially
be based on a convolution neural network classifier that will perform the classification.
